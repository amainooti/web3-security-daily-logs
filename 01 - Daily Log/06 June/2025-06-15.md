## What I worked on


I worked on layerEdge staking protocol that makes use of a first-come-first-serve tier ranking system using fenwick tree(binary index tree) each of the tier comes with their own dynamic APY(annual percentage yield), the contract has so much moving parts but I'm taking my time to look at each of them today I'm going to focus solely on understanding the staking function

| June 15 | LayerEdgeStaking.sol, interfaces | ðŸ”µ Medium      | 4h         | ðŸ§  90% focused       | I understood the staking there are other internal functions to check out (update interest which seems small but it calls calculateUnclaimedInterest which has a lot of calculations as this function calculates each tier within a users tier history to get their total interest another key function is called here which is getTierAPYPeriod) | Some functions unclear, revisit docs |
