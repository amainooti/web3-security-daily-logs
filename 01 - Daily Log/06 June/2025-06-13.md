## ‚úÖ What I Worked On

- Finalized and submitted my **Snowman Merkle Airdrop** findings to **CodeHawks**.
    
- Wrote structured reports using their format: summary, vulnerability details, PoC, tools used, impact, and recommendations.
    
- Reflected on audit process and recorded key PoCs and scripts.
    
- Marked the official end of this First Flight audit cycle.
    

### üîç Self-Review & Meta

- Ensured each bug was categorized (H/M/L), supported with reproducible PoCs, and clearly explained.
    
- Noticed I was much faster at identifying missing access control, state assumptions, and poor refund logic compared to earlier audits.
    
- Documented PoCs for:
    
    - NFT minting with no cap or access control
        
    - ETH/WETH overpayment handling
        
    - Merkle proof invalidation from dynamic balance checks
