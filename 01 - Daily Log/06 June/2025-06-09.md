### What I Worked On
1. I studied the ERC-721 openzeppline contract a bit just to understand some concepts about it
2. I reviewed and shadow audited a past cyfrin updraft first flight called [[02 - Shadow Audits/Weather Witness/Weather Witness]] 
3. Discovered some ways to think of NFT related protocols 

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned

 - Try and spend more time in "recon" mode ---the upfront understanding of what this contract is doing holistically.
 - Top hunters are not just "scanning" for syntax error or little low hanging fruits they simulate every function like an attacker would for example;
	 -  "What happens if I reuse this requestId? Hmmm... wait---Oh replay"
	 - "This contract mints using `msg.sender` , but the original requester isn't remembered? Oh frontrunable "
	 - What if I call this twice before state is updated ? Possible reentrancy?
- They don't read the code they walk through it line by line in their head, pretending to exploit it  

### ðŸ”Ž Bugs I Missed / Shouldâ€™ve Caught

1. The `fufillRequest` function (was missing an access control) meaning anyone can call this function worst part it allows the caller of the function mint the nft
   `mint(msg.sender, tokenId)` requestMintWeatherNFT is missing an access control anyone can call it and mint 
2. fufillMintRequest has no checks for the requestId meaning theres a replay that can occur where a known requestId can be reused 
3. Theres no withdraw function on this contract meaning the owner cannot withdraw funds leading to locked funds add an access control msg.sender == s_funcReqIdToUserMintReq[requestId].user, "Only original requester can fulfill mint" 
4. Multiple tokens for one `requestId` The `WeatherNFT::fulfillMintRequest` allows a malicious user to call multiple times the function with the same `requestId`. 
5. `fulfillMintRequest` allows anyone call it and then it mints to the caller `_mint(msg.sender, tokenId);` it does not mint to the original user but the caller of this function if a `requestMintWeatherNFT` was made and the reqId was seen an attacker can frontrun the user and mint the nft before them
6. Ensure the Mint has a max price in order to avoid runaway prices 
   ```js
 s_currentMintPice += s_stepMintPrice;
 if(currentMintPrice >= MAX_MINT_PRICE) WeatherNft__MAX_MINT_PRICE_REACHED();
```


### ðŸ“Œ Notes to Remember

1. When reviewing ERC-721 make sure to always check the mint function to see how it was implemented
2. Always check for access control; see who is calling what and who is allowed to do some things
3. Check any `transferfrom` logic 
4. Check for things like requestId /tokenId
5. Check how encoding is done is it a weak encoding using `encodePacked` and a dynamic datatype that can be seen in the mempool and easily gotten 
6. Check for any replays that can occur
