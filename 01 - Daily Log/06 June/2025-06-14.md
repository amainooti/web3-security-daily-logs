## What I Worked On â€“ June 14

Today, I attempted to shadow audit the **Crestal protocol**, which blends onchain and offchain interactions. Users can make proposals offchain, and Crestalâ€™s AI toolsâ€”alongside its contributor communityâ€”help design, launch, and evolve intelligent agents tailored to individual needs. It aims to deliver value in minutes, not months.

### ðŸ§  Self-Review & Reflection

Today wasnâ€™t my best day.

Despite starting the audit with intention, I felt unexpectedly fatigued and boredom. I didnâ€™t return to the codebase after the initial effort and instead defaulted to reading the public audit reportâ€”a shortcut that left me unsatisfied.

This experience made me feel like I wasted a valuable Saturday. For someone striving to become a top-tier auditor, this kind of disengagement isnâ€™t acceptable. Itâ€™s a signal that something in my mental model or audit environment needs fixing.

But I wonâ€™t let it slide.

Iâ€™ve since devised a structured system to ensure I **never walk away from a codebase prematurely** againâ€”no matter how large, abstract, or difficult it is. Iâ€™ll train myself to sit with discomfort, resist the urge for quick wins, and stay committed to deep, thorough auditing.

This is a pivot pointâ€”not a failure.
