## What I worked on

I worked on layerEdge staking protocol that makes use of a first-come-first-serve tier ranking system using fenwick tree(binary index tree) each of the tier comes with their own dynamic APY(annual percentage yield), the contract has so much moving parts but I'm taking my time to look at each of them today I'm going to focus solely on understanding the staking function
