### What I Worked On

Re-enforcing my knowledge  of off-chain signing and signature by reading the EIP-191 and EIP-712 proposals, going through some blogs [understanding-ethereum-signature-standard](https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/understanding-ethereum-signature-standards-eip-191-eip-712), also testing out signing and verifying for the purpose of further understanding signature replay attack, it's the chosen class of bug for the weekend deep dive.


### ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned

1. I learned about why EIP-712 was essential and replaced EIP-191 as it provided structure and more security.
2. The format of EIP-712 and what is considered bad practice i.e  line 6 below

```js
function execute(

ForwardRequest calldata req,

// @audit-high the domain seperator was passed as a user input
bytes32 domainSeparator,

bytes32 requestTypeHash,

bytes calldata suffixData,

bytes calldata sig

) external payable returns (bool success, bytes memory ret) {

_verifyNonce(req);

_verifySig(req, domainSeparator, requestTypeHash, suffixData, sig);

_updateNonce(req);

  

require(

req.to == _eurfAddress,

"NGEUR Forwarder: can only forward NGEUR transactions"

);

  

bytes4 transferSelector = bytes4(

keccak256("transfer(address,uint256)")

);

bytes4 reqTransferSelector = bytes4(req.data[:4]);

  

require(

reqTransferSelector == transferSelector,

"NGEUR Forwarder: can only forward transfer transactions"

);

  

// solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls

(success, ret) = req.to.call{gas: req.gas, value: req.value}(

abi.encodePacked(req.data, req.from)

);

require(success, "NGEUR Forwarder: failed tx execution");

  

_eurf.payGaslessBasefee(req.from, _msgSender());

  

return (success, ret);

}
```



### ðŸ”Ž Bugs I Missed / Shouldâ€™ve Caught

1. **Signature Replay Attack**
- Signature could be reused across chains due to:
    
    - Missing `chainId` in the domain separator
        
    - User-supplied domain separators (instead of computing on-chain)
        
    - No expiration (`deadline`) check
        
    - Shared nonces across chains



### ðŸ“Œ Notes to Remember

1. When checking for any ERC-712 implementation try and look at how they're signing the transaction, if the struct message has a nonce or if there's a ;
```js
mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;
```

Must be incremented _after_ every successful signature usage:

```js
nonces[from]++
```

2. Nonce mismatch across chains (same user, same nonce) = **replay risk**
3. **Domain Separation**

	- Ensure the contract **does not accept `domainSeparator` from user input**
    
	- Should derive it internally via:    
```js
keccak256(
	    abi.encode(
	    keccak256("EIP712Domain(...)"), 
	    nameHash, 
	    versionHash, 
	    chainId, 
	    contractAddress 
	  )
	)
```

4. **Expiration**
    
    - Signatures should not live forever â€” use a `deadline`:
        
        `require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Signature expired");`
        
5.  **What to Flag During Audit**
    
    - Custom metaTx / forwarding systems
        
    - No explicit `chainId` used in hashing
        
    - No `deadline` or expiry check
        
    - `domainSeparator` is passed externally
        
    - Same nonce pattern reused across multiple contracts
