## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

Reflect on what you deeply internalized:

- **Perspective switching:** Whenever you're auditing identify the roles whether directly or indirectly stated and then go through conditions where each of the roles cannot perform their tasks; under what condition can the liquidators not liquidate a user? under what condition can the user not mint/deposit/redeem etc this helps narrow things down and Identify bugs
    
- **Assumption breaking:** Try and challenge all assumptions of what is supposed to happen 
    
- **Real World Scenario Mapping:** What if BTC crashes?, what if collateral is not enough?
    
-  **Mathematical Modeling and Edge case inputs:** Translating business rules to math logic and what can happen in boundary inputs or extreme cases
	 
	- For example:
 
	`Alice deposits: $50 WBTC + $50 WETH = $100 total collateral
	`- Mints: $50 DSC
	    
	
	✅ Healthy
	
	Then WBTC crashes to zero:
	
	`- Collateral now = $50
	    
	`- Debt = $50
	    
	
	`healthFactor=(50∗1.1)/50 = 1.1 healthFactor = (50 * 1.1) / 50 = 1.1 
	`healthFactor=(50∗1.1)/50=1.1
	
	Still OK.
	
	Now if ETH drops to $45:
	
	`healthFactor=(45∗1.1)/50=0.99 healthFactor = (45 * 1.1) / 50 = 0.99 
	`healthFactor=(45∗1.1)/50=0.99
	
	Eligible for liquidation.
	
	But a liqUpon liquidation, the liquidator receives the user’s collateral equivalent to the debt repaid, plus a **10% liquidation bonus**. But this bonus is **insufficient** to offset the liquidator’s cost: they committed 2x the DSC value in collateral, yet only recover ~1.1x in liquidated assets.
	
	To reclaim the remaining portion of their own collateral, the liquidator would need to **burn more DSC**, which requires even more collateral—creating a loop that ultimately **breaks their own health factor**. As a result, the liquidator is **economically disincentivized** from participating, effectively **stalling the liquidation engine**.uidator must send $50 DSC and receive `50 * 1.1 = $55` collateral.
	
	You only have **$45 collateral**.
	
	💥 Liquidation **fails**, protocol bricks your bad debt.
	

tips arrange these math values in an excel sheet like this do calculations exam it extract **core formulas** 

| Scenario       | CV   | D    | LT  | HF Result |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- | --- | --------- |
| Safe           | 1000 | 500  | 1.1 | 2.2       |
| Borderline     | 1000 | 1000 | 1.1 | 1.1       |
| Liquidatable   | 900  | 1000 | 1.1 | 0.99      |
| Reversion risk | 105  | 100  | 1.1 | 1.155     |

**Ask key questions**
### 🔍 A. Rounding and Precision?

- Does this math **floor** or **truncate**? (`x / y * z`)
    
- Does it break for **small amounts**?
    
- Are units mismatched (1e18 vs 1e8)?
    

### 🔍 B. Safe Bounds?

- Is it safe near the **exact thresholds**?
    
    - What if `healthFactor == 1 exactly`?
        
- Is there **a range where action is blocked**, like between 1.0 and 1.1?
    

### 🔍 C. Frictionless Assumptions?

- Is the math assuming **no fees**, **no slippage**, or **perfect collateral transfer**?
    
- What happens with **fee-on-transfer tokens**?
    

### 🔍 D. Exploitable Ratios?

- Can a user **mint or withdraw** too much by manipulating price?
    
- Can an attacker **game incentives** due to how rewards are calculated?

## ❓Questions I didn't Ask

1. What if Price crashes?
2. What if balance is exact?
3. What if only 1 collateral exists?
4. What if there's no one to liquidate?
5. What if I'm the borrower?
6. What if I'm the liquidator?
7. What if I'm the protocol trying to stay solvent
8. What are some unique qualities of tokens that can mess up accounting and math? (rebase tokens, fee on transfer, token decimals basically something that can break invariants)
9.  Is liquidation actually profitable in practice?

| Action               | Cost                 | Return          | Notes                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Burn 50 DSC          | -$50                 | +$55 collateral | But… can I mint DSC again with that $55? 🤔 |
| To mint 50 DSC again | Need $100 collateral | Oops.           |                                             |


10. . **Can a liquidator become the next user at risk?**
> _If I spend DSC and get unusable collateral, did I just trap myself?_


##  🔫 Triggers

- The **liquidation bonus is fixed** (e.g., 10%).
    
- The **collateralization ratio is high** (e.g., 200%).
    
- The **minting logic is strict**.
    
- No incentives seem to be in place to **drive aggressive liquidation**.


## 🔎 Bugs I Missed / Should’ve Caught

1. **Liquidation is prevented due to strict implementation of liquidation bonus**
		Due to the a strict 1.1 bonus (10%) implementation, severely under-collateralized users cannot be liquidated due to the fact that if they have no collateral(100% undercollaterized maybe due to price dump)  no bonus can be applied leading to the  `liquidate` function reverting causing a DOS inadvertently

2.  **Finding: Lack of `minDepositAmount` Creates Unliquidatable Dust Accounts**
		The protocol allows users to deposit very small amounts (e.g., $5–$10), then mint stablecoins just below or near the collateral limit. When these users become slightly undercollateralized due to price shifts, **liquidators are disincentivized** because the gas cost outweighs the liquidation bonus. These accounts are effectively ignored — the protocol absorbs bad debt over time.
		
3. **Miscalculation of other token decimals that are not 18** 
	WBTC which has 8 decimals 
	 the equation `priceFeed * amount` doesn't account for `priceFeed = 8 dec.. and amount = 8 dec...` which gives 16 rather than 18  


4. **Protocol liquidation arithmetics leads to liquidators losing more than they gain**
	In the current liquidation flow, a liquidator is required to mint DSC in order to repay a delinquent user’s debt. However, minting DSC necessitates depositing **twice the DSC value in collateral** due to the protocol’s 200% over-collateralization requirement.

	Upon liquidation, the liquidator receives the user’s collateral equivalent to the debt repaid, plus a **10% liquidation bonus**. But this bonus is **insufficient** to offset the liquidator’s cost: they committed 2x the DSC value in collateral, yet only recover ~1.1x in liquidated assets.
	
	To reclaim the remaining portion of their own collateral, the liquidator would need to **burn more DSC**, which requires even more collateral—creating a loop that ultimately **breaks their own health factor**. As a result, the liquidator is **economically disincentivized** from participating, effectively **stalling the liquidation engine**.
