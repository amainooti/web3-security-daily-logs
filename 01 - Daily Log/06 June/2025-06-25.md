## ✅ What I Worked On

**Protocol:** The Rewarder — Merkle-based Reward Distributor (Damn Vulnerable DeFi)

**Type:** Merkle-claim CTF using off-chain JSON snapshots and on-chain proofs

### 🔧 Core Purpose

To distribute ERC20 rewards (DVT & WETH) to eligible addresses using Merkle proofs. Each user claims their allocated amount using a Merkle proof derived from an off-chain JSON dataset.

### 🧱 Architecture

- `distributions[token]`: Maps token to a `Distribution` struct containing:
    
    - `remaining` tokens
        
    - `root` (Merkle root)
        
    - `claims[msg.sender][wordPosition]`: bitmaps to track claims per user
        
- `claimRewards(Claim[], IERC20[])`: Accepts a batch of claims for various tokens and validates/updates claim status
    
- `_setClaimed`: Core claim-tracking mechanism. Checks a bitmap position for whether a claim was made, then sets it.
    

### 🔁 Key Flow

1. Player submits a `Claim`:
    
    - Contains `batchNumber`, `amount`, `tokenIndex`, and `proof`.
        
2. `claimRewards` verifies proof using `Merkle.verifyProof(...)`.
    
3. `_setClaimed(...)` sets bitmap slot via `word | newBits`.
    
4. If not already claimed, transfers tokens and reduces `remaining`.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- **Merkle proof abuse:** You can reuse the same valid Merkle proof if claim uniqueness isn’t enforced across batched submissions.
    
- **Faulty per-token claim tracking:** Claims are tracked independently for each token. This means one Merkle proof can be reused for multiple tokens.
    
- **Bitwise claim tracking:** Learned how a 256-bit word per user can be manipulated to simulate multiple claims by varying bit positions.
    
- **Batch draining:** By batching multiple identical claims using the same proof but bypassing uniqueness validation, it's possible to drain more tokens than allowed.

## 🔎 Bugs I Missed / Should’ve Caught

### 🐛 Poor tokenIndex uniqueness enforcement

- **Bug:** The system doesn't verify that each proof is used _once per address_, across tokens. So I reused the same proof for multiple DVT claims in a single call.
    
- **Where:** `_setClaimed` only checks per `(token, wordPosition)`. There's no global check for claim identity or reuse.
    
- **Impact:** Infinite reuse of the same Merkle proof within the same batch → partial/full drain of tokens.
    
- **Why I Missed It Initially:** I focused on the Merkle verification and proof generation, assuming that per-user, per-token claims were isolated by proof.
    
- **How I'll Catch It Next Time:** Add a **mental checklist**: “Does this system enforce _uniqueness_ of claims globally or just locally (per token/batch)?”

## 🧪 Hypotheses I Tested That Didn’t Work

- _“What if I just resubmit the exact same proof twice?”_  
    → **Reverted** — `_setClaimed` caught it via `(word & newBits) != 0`.
    
- _“Maybe different tokens share the same claim map?”_  
    → **Nope** — each token has its own bitmap, making them independent.
    
- _“Can I slightly modify the amount and still pass verification?”_  
    → **Invalid proof** — Merkle proof is tightly bound to `(address, amount)`.
    
- _“Can I manipulate the index or tokenIndex to overlap with a new bit slot?”_  
    → Partially successful — allowed reuse by varying bit positions across batched claims for the **same** token.

## 🧾 Notes to Remember

- Always check **what the Merkle proof binds**: is it `(address + token + amount)` or just `(address + amount)`? That affects replayability.
    
- If a contract uses **bitmaps for tracking**, exploit vector = _bit collisions_, _batch logic_, or _per-asset desync_.
    
- Build a **claim visualization map** (address → token → wordPosition → claimed bit) when auditing bitmap logic.
    
- **Post-claim residual validation** matters — do tokens decrease as expected?
    
- Be suspicious of **multi-token claim flows** — they often skip shared state verification across tokens.
    
- On any Merkle-based contract, try:  
    `for i in 0..N: submit same proof with different tokenIndex or slightly varied bits`.

## 🧰 Mini PoC Flow (Successful Exploit)


```js

function test_theRewarder() public checkSolvedByPlayer {

// Load distribution leaves again

bytes32[] memory dvtLeaves = _loadRewards("/test/the-rewarder/dvt-distribution.json");

bytes32[] memory wethLeaves = _loadRewards("/test/the-rewarder/weth-distribution.json");

  

// Generate Merkle proofs at index 188

bytes32[] memory dvtProof = merkle.getProof(dvtLeaves, 188);

bytes32[] memory wethProof = merkle.getProof(wethLeaves, 188);

  

uint256 dvtAmount = 11524763827831882; // exact amount for index 188

uint256 wethAmount = 1171088749244340;

  

// Setup claim struct

uint256 dvtMaxDrain = distributor.getRemaining(address(dvt)) / dvtAmount;

uint256 wethMaxDrain = distributor.getRemaining(address(weth)) / wethAmount;

  

Claim[] memory claims = new Claim[](dvtMaxDrain + wethMaxDrain);

uint256 idx = 0;

  

for (uint256 i = 0; i < dvtMaxDrain; i++) {

claims[idx++] = Claim({batchNumber: 0, amount: dvtAmount, tokenIndex: 0, proof: dvtProof});

}

  

for (uint256 i = 0; i < wethMaxDrain; i++) {

claims[idx++] = Claim({batchNumber: 0, amount: wethAmount, tokenIndex: 1, proof: wethProof});

}

  

IERC20[] memory tokens = new IERC20[](2);

tokens[0] = IERC20(address(dvt));

tokens[1] = IERC20(address(weth));

//Claim the rewards

distributor.claimRewards(claims, tokens);

console.log(dvt.balanceOf(address(distributor)));

  

dvt.transfer(recovery, dvt.balanceOf(player));

weth.transfer(recovery, weth.balanceOf(player));

}
