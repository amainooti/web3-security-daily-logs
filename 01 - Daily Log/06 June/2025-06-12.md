## âœ… What I Worked On

I worked on the **Snowman Merkle Airdrop First Flight** audit.

This protocol allows users to either farm or buy $SNOW (ERC20), which they can then use to mint NFTs. Farming is time-gated (once per week, up to 12 weeks), and the buying flow supports both ETH and WETH payments. A Merkle-based airdrop system allows eligible addresses to claim NFTs based on an off-chain snapshot.

### Core Purpose

Distribute NFTs in a fair, permissionless way based on staking or buying $SNOW, while enabling Merkle-proof based claims for early users or farmers.

### Architecture / Contract Breakdown

- `Snow.sol`: Core ERC20 contract with minting, farming, and buying logic.
    
- `Snowman.sol`: ERC721 contract responsible for NFT minting.
    
- `SnowmanAirdrop.sol`: Airdrop contract validating Merkle proofs for claims.
    
- Scripts: Merkle generation (`SnowMerkle.s.sol`), helpers, and tests.
    

### Key Flows

- **Farming**: Users call `earnSnow()` once per week.
    
- **Buying**: Users pay ETH/WETH to mint $SNOW tokens.
    
- **Minting NFTs**: Users use $SNOW to mint `Snowman` NFTs.
    
- **Airdrop Claim**: Users prove eligibility using Merkle proofs + EIP-712 signatures.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned

### Technical Concepts

- **Merkle Trees**: Learned how leaf nodes are generated using `(address, amount)` and how Merkle proofs verify inclusion in an off-chain snapshot.
    
- **Encoding/Typecasting**: Understood how to pad addresses, how `address` (20 bytes) maps to `uint160` and then `bytes32`, and how ABI encoding works under the hood.
    
- **Memory Layout**: Got exposed to concepts like offset/length (even if I havenâ€™t done a deep dive yet).
    

### Audit Techniques

- Tracing state updates across contracts (especially farming and airdrop logic).
    
- Simulating real-world actor behavior (e.g., users buying with ETH but approving WETH).
    
- Looking for classic patterns: missing access control, insufficient validation, no cap logic.

## ðŸ”Ž Bugs I Missed / Shouldâ€™ve Caught

- Nothing major missed, but I couldâ€™ve caught the Merkle balance mismatch earlier if I had fully mapped the flow before writing tests.

## ðŸ§ª Hypotheses I Tested That Didnâ€™t Work

1. **Hypothesis**:  
    I suspected the `claimSnowman()` function would allow double claims since there was a state update (`s_hasClaimedSnowman[receiver] = true`) but no **prior check** for it.

    
    ```js
// No guard clause like: 
if (s_hasClaimedSnowman[receiver]) {     
    revert AlreadyClaimed();
     }
    ```
    
2. **What I Tried**:  
    I wrote a PoC where Ashley (a test address) was dealt `2 $SNOW` and tried to call `claimSnowman()` twice. I expected this to succeed.
    
3. **What Actually Happened**:  
    The _first claim failed immediately_ due to a mismatch between Ashleyâ€™s **on-chain balance** and the **off-chain snapshotted balance** used in the Merkle tree leaf.
    
    
    ```js
uint256 amount = i_snow.balanceOf(receiver); bytes32 leaf =  keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(receiver, amount))));
 
```

    Because the leaf was created using the _current balance_ and not the **snapshotted balance**, any user who altered their holdings (e.g., farmed, bought, or transferred $SNOW after snapshot) would fail Merkle proof verification.
    
4. **Outcome / Lesson**:  
    My initial guess about missing claim guards was **valid**, but the more critical issue I discovered was the flawed assumption around using dynamic `balanceOf()` for Merkle verification â€” which led to a more impactful finding than I originally hypothesized.

## ðŸ§¾ Notes to Remember

- Always validate state assumptions (e.g., snapshot balance â‰  current balance).
    
- Visualize token/ETH flow across branches, especially when mixed payment methods exist.
    
- Personal reminder: in contest settings, assume users will try to bypass **any** validation or **abuse** multi-path logic (e.g., ETH path vs WETH path).
    
- Make better use of Merkle libraries and encode/decode helpers to avoid guesswork.
