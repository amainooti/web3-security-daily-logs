## ✅ What I Worked On

Summarize each protocol/project:

- Name + type (e.g. NFT-based dating app, cultural lottery)
    
- Core purpose
    
- Architecture/contract breakdown
    
- Key flows (entrypoints, minting, matching, claiming, etc.)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

Reflect on what you deeply internalized:

- Audit techniques that worked (e.g., tracing money flow, visualizing state updates)
    
- Patterns spotted (e.g., missed `require`, faulty assumptions, poor modifiers)
    
- Strategies improved (e.g., testing with real values, simulating multiple actors)

## 🔎 Bugs I Missed / Should’ve Caught

List missed bugs (or ones you caught late):

- Describe the bug clearly
    
- Mention which contract/function
    
- State impact (severity, user consequence)
    
- Why you missed it + how you’ll catch it next time

## 🧪 Hypotheses I Tested That Didn’t Work

Train your audit intuition by writing:

- “I suspected this function could allow X because of Y...”
    
- “I tried to drain funds via Z but was blocked by…”
    

Even failed attempts improve your understanding and pattern detection.

## 🧾 Notes to Remember

Ongoing lessons or reminders to apply:

- Audit process improvements (e.g., “always trace balance deltas end-to-end”)
    
- Personal systems (e.g., visual maps of state updates, function call tracing)
    
- Meta-learning (e.g., "contest mindset is different, simulate it with POCs and structured reports")

## 🧰 Mini PoC Scripts / Flow Outlines (Optional)

> _Write high-level PoC ideas or exploit flows for key bugs — even if they’re pseudocode or tx walkthroughs._
