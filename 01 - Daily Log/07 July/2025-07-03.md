### 📍 **Contest**: Sherlock – DeBank DEX Aggregator (DexSwap)

### 🎯 **Goal**: Understand core system architecture, prep for threat modeling tomorrow

---

### 🧠 **Summary**

Cloned the repo, logged scope, and read the high-level overview.

DeBank’s DexSwap system includes its **own optimized DEX aggregator**, alongside support for third-party ones like 1inch and Paraswap. The custom aggregator handles **routing, execution, and adapter logic** across multiple DEXs.

---

### 🧱 **Architecture Overview (from docs)**

- 📌 `Router.sol`: Trade entry point, manages funds
    
- 📌 `Adapter/`: Unifies interaction with external DEXs (Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, etc.)
    
- 📌 `Executor/`: Handles trade splitting, route optimization, and execution logic
    

---

### 📝 **Initial Thoughts**

- Protocol is performing **external calls and fund movements**, so:
    
    - 🔥 Token misaccounting / reentrancy
        
    - 🔥 Slippage front-running
        
    - 🔥 Unsafe calldata forwarding
        
    - 🔥 Poor handling of native ETH/WETH
        
    - 🔥 Broken price protection = silent losses

## 🧭 TODOs for `2025-07-04`

### 📌 Obsidian Folder: `02 - shadow audit/2025-07 - DeBank DexSwap`

#### 🎨 System Mapping

-  Create base Excalidraw system diagram
    
    - `Router` → `Executor` → `Adapter`
        
    - Include third-party aggregators (1inch, Paraswap)
        
    - Include direct integrations (Uniswap, Curve, etc.)
        

#### 🔍 Code Entry

-  Open `Router.sol` and trace user flow
    
    -  Identify key entry points (`swap`, etc.)
        
    -  Log any `delegatecall`, `call`, `transfer`, or `approve` operations
        
-  Skim `Executor.sol` and note key helper methods (e.g. `calculateSplitRoutes`)
    
-  Open one adapter (`UniAdapter.sol`) and note structure
    

#### 🧠 Threat Model Draft

-  Start high-level threat model sketch in vault
    
    - Abuse scenarios: split manipulation, over-approval, zero slippage protection, etc.
        
    - Write assumptions & questions for each module
