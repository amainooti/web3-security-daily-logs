### ✅ What I Worked On

Continuation of [[2025-07-01]]

I'm also reviewing silo-finance report today
## ❓Questions I didn't Ask

11. - **“Did the inherited contract expose any `public` or `external` functions?”**  
    → (esp. `mintFrom`, `burnFrom`, `transferFrom`, `approve`-like)
    
12.  **“Does this protocol assume only the owner can burn or mint?”**  
    → If yes, **any other burn/mint path is a red flag.**
    
13. **“If the dev wrote a custom burn() with `onlyOwner`, why does the parent also allow `burnFrom()` without restrictions?”**  
    → That mismatch is the bug.
    
14. **“Can I call any inherited function to replicate what the restricted function does?”**  
    → Eg: `burnFrom()` lets me bypass `onlyOwner` on `burn()`.
    
15. **“Is there any way I can use `approve()` + inherited function to do something the dev tried to restrict?”**  
    → This catches _many_ inherited approval/allowance edge cases.
16. **This takes in an array of tokens are there any constraints on what can be passed?**
17. **How are allowed collateral tokens initialized?** 
18. **What if a token appears more than once?**
19. **What happens if liquidators health factor is unhealthy? **
20. **All ways liquidators can interact with the protocol**

###  🔫 Triggers

- “Uses `Ownable`, but inherits something that exposes public methods”
-  “The contract exposes `ERC20Burnable`, but also defines its own `burn()`”
- “mint() and burn() are marked `onlyOwner`, but the base contract is not shown”
- “There’s a custom `burn()` function with `onlyOwner`”
- “This contract inherits from OpenZeppelin’s `ERC20Burnable` or `ERC20Preset`”
- For loop passes multiple tokens `are there duplicates?`



### 🔎 Bugs I Missed / Should’ve Caught

5. **Any one can burn DecentralizedStableCoin tokens with the `burnFrom` function**
	the intention of the protocol here is that `onlyOwner` can mint and burn but the tokens can be burned with `burnFrom` function bypassing the `onlyOwner` modifier
6. **Double spending vulnerability leads to a disruption of the DSC token**
		this code that includes the tokens into the array does not check for duplicates
```js
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenAddresses.length; i++) {

	s_priceFeeds[tokenAddresses[i]] = priceFeedAddresses[i]; // sets the priceFeedAddresses
	
	s_collateralTokens.push(tokenAddresses[i]); // push to the collateralTokens array
	
	}`
		
	
	```

>implications: If a user deposits `10 ETH` if eth is listed twice then its treated as 20 eth and is effectively counted twice this can result in malicious users minting more tokens than allowed by doubling their collateral value
