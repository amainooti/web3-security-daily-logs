### 📅 2025-07-05 — **Day 2 of Contest**

#### 🛠 Work Summary:

- Deep-dived into the **Router** and **DexSwap** flows in the DeBank Aggregator system.
    
- Understood how both flows rely heavily on the `Adapter` contract, which delegates to specific DEX executors (UniswapV2, V3, CurveV1, V2, etc.).
    
- Mapped out the **fee logic**, `spender.swap()` call structure, and how encoded calldata is routed via `delegatecall`.
    
- Verified the role of the `executeSimpleSwap` selector in adapter delegation.
    
- Identified that both Router and DexSwap rely on `Adapter1`, even though it’s injected dynamically.
    
- Investigated adapter whitelist enforcement in `Executor`.
    
- Validated adapter registration and removal flows (`setAdapter`, `removeAdapter`) and their safeguards.
    
- Confirmed no DAO/gov system — all control rests with 3 hardcoded admins with pause consensus.
    

#### 📈 Key Wins:

- Built and refined a complete text-based architectural map of contract relationships.
    
- Spotted how core logic concentrates in adapters and that `delegatecall` exposes storage risk.
    
- Recognized that while Router supports multi-path, DexSwap is a simplified pathless route — but both converge at Adapter1.
    

#### 🧠 Mental Model Built:

- **Flow ownership**: Router handles multi-hop paths → Executor → Adapter.
    
- **Fee flow**: Charged either before or after swap, based on `feeOnFromToken`.
    
- **Adapter1** is the DEX interaction hub.
    
- **Spender** and **Executor** both delegatecall adapters; adapter logic runs in their context.
    
- Importance of tightly managing the adapter whitelist.
    

#### ⚠️ Potential Vulnerabilities:

- `delegatecall` into Adapter1 runs in caller context (storage clobbering potential).
    
- Fee receiver address is user-supplied — may be worth looking at refund/token abuse scenarios.
    
- Admin-controlled adapter injection is powerful — if attacker is admin or can bypass checks, this is critical.
    

#### ⏱️ Time Estimate:

~7+ hours active investigation, modeling, and back-and-forth architectural mapping.
