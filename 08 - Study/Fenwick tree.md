Fenwick tree (Binary index tree): This allows range calculations such as computing a total across a range of numbers without having to examine all the numbers in the range. Suppose we have an array of length 10 and we wanted to find the total between the indices `(i - j)` 
TODO: Come back to this range of values thing



Things to note before really understanding this

~ stands for bitwise Not operator
& stands for bitwise And operator

6 & 3 means get the bit of 6 and 3 and then look for the and of it

6 = 0110 
3 = 0100 
 =  0100 bitwise of this becomes 3
