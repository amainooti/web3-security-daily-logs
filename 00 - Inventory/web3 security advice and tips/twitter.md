1. The saying "Stare into the abyss long enough and it stare right back at you" truth applies to code; read code long enough and it reads you back. I remember spending the last weeks in my first month as an auditor reading silofinance codebase it was one of my first shadow audits and it felt so much in reality it was under 2k but damn it felt so much probably took me 1 week to finish reading the code and assimilating it got me imagining how say ~10k nsloc would feel like I was up for it tho at the time I wanted to mainly learn from the code itself wanted it to talk to me and tell me its secrets.
