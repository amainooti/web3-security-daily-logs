# Damn vulnerable defi v4 Puppet

  
*Problem statement*

There’s a lending pool where users can borrow Damn Valuable Tokens (DVTs). To do so, they first need to deposit twice the borrow amount in ETH as collateral. The pool currently has 100000 DVTs in liquidity.

There’s a DVT market opened in an old Uniswap v1 exchange, currently with 10 ETH and 10 DVT in liquidity.

Pass the challenge by saving all tokens from the lending pool, then depositing them into the designated recovery account. You start with 25 ETH and 1000 DVTs in balance.
