# Unstoppable

  

There's a tokenized vault with a million DVT tokens deposited. Itâ€™s offering flash loans for free, until the grace period ends.

To catch any bugs before going 100% permissionless, the developers decided to run a live beta in testnet. There's a monitoring contract to check liveness of the flashloan feature.

Starting with 10 DVT tokens in balance, show that it's possible to halt the vault. It must stop offering flash loans.



### Quick Notes
1. The EIP-4626 inherits from erc-20 meaning it has basic functions like `transfer` , `transferFrom` , `balanceOf`.



The fact that the contract is an erc20 means that it can receive funds via `transfer` it doesn't have a deposit function 

## Solution
just transfer some funds to break the invariant.
