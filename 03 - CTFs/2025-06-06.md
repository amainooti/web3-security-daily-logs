# Puppet V2

### problem statement

The developers of the [previous pool](https://damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/puppet/) seem to have learned the lesson. And released a new version.

Now theyâ€™re using a Uniswap v2 exchange as a price oracle, along with the recommended utility libraries. Shouldn't that be enough?
You start with 20 ETH and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The pool has a million DVT tokens in balance at risk!

Save all funds from the pool, depositing them into the designated recovery account.



### Attack sequence
1. You crash the DVT price by dumping a ton of DVT into Uniswap.
    
2. The oracle (Uniswap price) now reports DVT is nearly worthless.
    
3. You call `borrow(1_000_000 ether)` (1M DVT).
    
4. The pool calculates a tiny amount of WETH is needed (e.g. ~9 WETH).
    
5. You provide that WETH, and receive 1M DVT tokens.

## Mistake's I made during this exploit

1. I messed up the swap path not knowing it determines the order of swappimg
   ```diff
-  address[] memory path = new address[](2);
-        path[0] = address(weth);
-       path[1] = address(token);

+ address[] memory path = new address[](2);
+        path[0] = address(token);
+       path[1] = address(weth);

```

2. Forgetting to fund my attacker contract 



## The main exploit

```js
function _getOracleQuote(uint256 amount) private view returns (uint256) {

(uint256 reservesWETH, uint256 reservesToken) =

UniswapV2Library.getReserves({factory: _uniswapFactory, tokenA: address(_weth), tokenB: address(_token)});

  

return UniswapV2Library.quote({amountA: amount * 10 ** 18, reserveA: reservesToken, reserveB: reservesWETH});

}
```


As you can see it makes use of the reserves in the uniswap to determine the price 

```js
function quote(uint256 amountA, uint256 reserveA, uint256 reserveB) internal pure returns (uint256 amountB) {

require(amountA > 0, "UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_AMOUNT");

require(reserveA > 0 && reserveB > 0, "UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY");

amountB = amountA * reserveB / reserveA;

}
```


If you look at the quote it makes use of the reserve to calculate `amountB` since it's still heavily reliant on uniswap reserves we can exploit it.
